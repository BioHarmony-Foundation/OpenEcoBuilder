# OpenVillage
Building and Simulating EcoVillages with OpenSource Technology


## Goals

### OpenSource Everything
From the technology used to create the simulator to the objects that are used within the simulator, everything must be Open Source.

#### Technology
* git
* Blender
* Godot
* Docker (hosting and local work
* Python (any glue or automation)
* Django

#### Simulation Objects
We would love to partner with existing OpenSource projects that aim to build EcoVillages.
* Open Source Ecology
* One Community Global
* Open to new contributions

From there, add on and fill in the gaps with more plans. Every placeable object will have it's visual model, as well as links to the plans to build the thing in real life yourself. Once you've simulated your village, it should be a smooth transition to start building it.


### Always Free
Anyone should be able to run this and start building their own OpenVillage. No pay wall, ever.

### Sponsors

Do you have a product that people may want to buy, to help them build their EcoVillage?
Do you teach classes or host workshops that help people build their EcoVillages?
Do you simply believe in a future full of regenerative EcoVillages?

If so, we are open and welcome to sponsors. Get your logo and link in this repo, and get featured as we build and test this thing.
