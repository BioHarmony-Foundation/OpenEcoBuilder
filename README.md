# OpenEcoBuilder
Building and Simulating Open Ecological Ideas with OpenSource Technology

POC and Kickstarter to come soon. Until then, imagine with me, a piece of software:

Freely available to download on most modern devices. When it boots up, you can either choose to explore a sample library of Homesteads, OffGrid Retreats, and EcoVillages that can show you possible EcoLogical Lifestyles — or input your own Latitude and Longitude coordinates to import a chunk of earth, and get to building one yourself. Imagine a searchable drag-and-drop library of DIY Tutorials, BioRegional Educators and Workshops, and EcoProducts.

Instead of Roller Coasters and the Boxed-In-Life, let’s build the world WE want to see.

## Who is it for?
Anyone who wants to build their own OffGrid Ecological Lifestyle, or contribute to helping others do the same.
* Homesteaders
* EcoResorts
* OffGrid Retreats
* EcoVillages
* Intentional Communities
* Educators and Workshop Leaders
* EcoProduct Creators

## Goals

### OpenSource Everything
From the technology used to create the simulator to the information referenced within the simulator, everything must be Open Source, free to download, and free and easy to contribute to. No subscription fees, no pay-to-play content. A robust core platform that allows "non-coders" to easily contribute new ideas.

### Distributed Architecture
* To keep the simulator small and easy to download, content will be distributed into "DLCs" by BioRegion and general Category.
* The git repositories will be mirrored on multiple platforms, as well as by any contributors.
* The platform stays "light" by linking out to other existing resources instead of trying to encapsulate the details itself.

## Technology
OpenSource tools to work with and build on top of.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

## OpenSource Partnerships
We would love to partner with and link to existing OpenSource projects with similar values.
* [One Community Global](https://www.onecommunityglobal.org/)
* [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/)
* [OikoSol](https://github.com/OikoSol/)
* And any other OpenSource projects we haven't met yet that would like to contribute!

## BioRegional Workshops and Educators
Once the platform is up, add yourself to the BioRegional directory for people to find you and learn from you.

## EcoProduct Sponsors
Do you have a product that people may want to buy, to help them on their journey to Ecological abundance?
Join our sponsors to have your products listed as an option alongside the OpenSource DIY plans, for those who have more money than time.
A minimal referral fee will help us fund the project to keep it well maintained and thriving.
