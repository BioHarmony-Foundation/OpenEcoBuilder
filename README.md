# OpenVillage
Building and Simulating EcoVillages entirely out of OpenSource


## Goals

### OpenSource Everything
From the technology used to create the simulator to the objects that are used within the simulator, everything must be Open Source.

#### Technology
* git
* Blender
* Godot

#### Simulation Objects
Start with partnering with existing OpenSource projects that aim to build villages. From there, add on and fill in the gaps with more plans. Every placeable object will have it's visual model, as well as links to the plans to build the thing in real life yourself. Once you've simulated your village, it should a smooth transition to start building it.

* Open Source Ecology
* One Community Global
* Open to new contributions


### Always Free
Anyone should be able to run this and start building their own OpenVillage. No pay wall, ever.

### ?Sponsorhips?
This one kind of goes against "OpenSource Everything," and I'm still trying to decide how I feel about it. But there are companies out there doing their best to create eco-friendly products that could help speed up village building (if you have the money). Adding their models with links to their websites may be a way to increase adoption and get sponsorship to fuel the growth of the project. I am considering companies like GeoShip, EkoDome, HomeBioGas, etc.
